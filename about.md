For a number of different applications, it's really important that neural networks don't make flawed predictions. 
As a PhD student in the Oxford Robotics Institute, I've spent the last few years researching uncertainty estimation for deep learning to address this problem in the context of safe robot deployment.
Over the course of my studies, my group and I have developed a number of methods that can train neural networks that make either accurate and confident estimates, or express high uncertainty (seen below).  

More broadly, my main interest is the design of techniques that allow the *robust* application of deep learning to challenging *real-world* problems.
