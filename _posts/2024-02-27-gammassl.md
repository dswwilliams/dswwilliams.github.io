### Overview:
It is important that methods used in safety-critical settings know when they are likely to fail. Therefore, uncertainty estimation in deep learning is a key field for applications such as robotics. This method, named GammaSSL, trains a segmentation network that can estimate when it is likely to fail as a result of distributional shift - i.e. performs distributional uncertainty estimation. It achieves this by using uncurated, unlabelled out-of-distribution training images.
