### Overview:
Audio classifiers are easy to train, therefore why not use them to supervise other tasks?
We generate sparse segmentation labels by combining motion estimates with audio classification estimates.
Our method segments permissible routes in [FMCW](https://www.radartutorial.eu/02.basics/Frequency%20Modulated%20Continuous%20Wave%20Radar.en.html) radar scans using this weak supervision.
