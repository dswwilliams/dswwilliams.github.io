### Overview:
This method extends the work in [GammaSSL]({% link _posts/2024-02-27-gammassl.md %}) by encorporating foundation models ([DINOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193)) and masked image modeling. Foundation models possess a general representation which is highly suited to performing distributional uncertainty estimation, but which suffers when fine-tuning takes place. This method provides a way of both finetuning a foundation model to perform a specific task, while keeping the quality of uncertainty estimation high. Masked image modeling is used as a simpler, less hyperparameter-dependent alternative to the augmentation task in [GammaSSL]({% link _posts/2024-02-27-gammassl.md %}).
